# MCR - Bob The Racer
This project is part of the HEIG-VD design pattern course. We created a little car racing game to present and show the benefits of the [builder pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder).

You can create 2 cars step by step or randomly (player1 and player2 cars), and after that you will be able to generate random bots to have more opponents. When all your racers are ready you can start the race and show who will be the best racer !
